did not have a second parallel street (i.e., alleys that back up to woods,
train tracks, etc.) were named with the parallel street name and post type
followed by “Rear” (e.g. TUSCANY CT REAR) to prevent potential name
duplication. If there were multiple alleys in a single block, they were named
as above, then numbered from west to east or north to south (e.g.,

The central mission of the 911 Behavioral Health Diversion project is to match individuals to the most appropriate and available resource. Individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis will be connected to a crisis hotline staffed 24/7 by trained mental health professionals. Co-response occurs when patients are connected to the crisis line and there is some degree of response by BPD or BCFD resources. Although the 911 Diversion Pilot is an immediate step, the City intends to expand 911 diversion beyond behavioral health responses – such as considering improved use of peer supports, housing opportunities, and community-based youth diversion.

Use this Map This map is designed to be used as a basemap for overlaying other layers of information or as a stand-alone reference map.  You can add layers to this web map and save as your own map.  If you like, you can add this web map to a custom basemap gallery for others in your organization to use in creating web maps.  If you would like to add this map as a layer in other maps you are creating, you may use the tile layer item referenced in this map. Customize this Map Because this map includes a vector tile layer, you can customize the map to change its content and symbology.  You are able to turn on and off layers, change symbols for layers, switch to alternate local language (in some areas), and refine the treatment of disputed boundaries.  For details on how to customize this map, please refer to the Esri Vector Basemap Reference Document (v2) and vector basemap articles on the ArcGIS Online Blog.

The City of Baltimore holds an annual tax lien certificate sale. The tax sale is used to collect delinquent real property taxes and other unpaid charges owed to the City, all of which are liens against the real property. It is a public, online auction of City lien interests on properties. The highest bidder in the auction pays the total amount of the property liens to the City and receives a tax sale certificate from the City which gives the bidder the right to obtain ownership of the property by filing a tax sale foreclosure lawsuit. The owner of the property can prevent the highest bidder from obtaining ownership by ""redeeming"" the property. Redemption requires the owner or an interested party, such as a mortgage holder, to reimburse the successful bidder for the amount of liens and other charges paid to the City, as well as the bidder’s interest and other fees and costs set by law. If a property has not been redeemed from tax sale, the ""REDEMPTION DATE"" field will be blank.

The City of Baltimore holds an annual tax lien certificate sale. The tax sale is used to collect delinquent real property taxes and other unpaid charges owed to the City, all of which are liens against the real property. It is a public, online auction of City lien interests on properties. The highest bidder in the auction pays the total amount of the property liens to the City and receives a tax sale certificate from the City which gives the bidder the right to obtain ownership of the property by filing a tax sale foreclosure lawsuit. The owner of the property can prevent the highest bidder from obtaining ownership by ""redeeming"" the property. Redemption requires the owner or an interested party, such as a mortgage holder, to reimburse the successful bidder for the amount of liens and other charges paid to the City, as well as the bidder’s interest and other fees and costs set by law. If a property has not been redeemed from tax sale, the ""REDEMPTION DATE"" field will be blank. More information on the tax sale process can be found at: Tax Sale Information In the 2021 tax sale, Mayor Brandon Scott announced that certain properties would be exempted from the tax sale.

Attribute information includes details about park location, acreage, ownership,    managing entity, and park category. Parks are categorized as: Citywide parks: Parks that serve residents across the entire city and host a variety of permitted and non-permitted recreational activities or facilities. They tend to be the larger parks in the city ranging from ten acres to over 990 acres in size. While this represents a wide range in size, several of the smaller parks are part of a larger contiguous park network. Neighborhood parks: These parks serve as basic units of the park system for users within a quarter to half-mile distance. They range between 1 and 28 acres in size and typically offer two or more amenities such as a playground, basketball court, athletic field, and green spaces. Many of the Neighborhood parks are informal in design, are clearly visible and located along well trafficked streets. Mini parks: Small parks that may include one or two amenities such as a pavilion, seating area, playground, or basketball court. Many of the Mini Parks are sited off the beaten path, some are located behind houses or bordered by less trafficked streets. These parks are typically less than 3 acres in size. Green spaces:  Open lawn spaces without amenities and of varied size. These spaces serve as flexible spaces for active or passive use. Some include community gardens. Special use: Stand-alone park spaces that have a specific use or role associated with them. Forested spaces: Wooded or forested areas that may or may not be accessible to the public. Civic spaces: Spaces that are significant to the City’s history, host monuments or contain paved plazas that are used for citywide events and gatherings related to recreation and parks or other non BCRP related activities.

To manage this crisis, our Office of Emergency Management (OEM) in the Fire Department activated the City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and a cross-agency team pulled together to distribute water to parts of the City under the advisory. During emergencies, timely and accurate information is crucial and in these moments you don’t want responders to have to wrestle with clunky tools. Moreover, the City may have data or capacity that can help in the situation that your OEM isn’t aware of.

The map also includes a reference layer. Content meant to provide spatial context (the basemap) should recede in visual priority, helping to establish the thematic layers that they support (rather than compete with them).  There are many ways to sufficiently mute your basemap, but for satellite imagery, de-saturation is a nice option. An image that is all or mostly black and white won’t compete as much with the brightly colored thematic data that it supports.  With this map, the color of the imagery is mostly removed at the smallest global scales and then gradually re-introduced at the larger scales, where the full detail of the imagery is available.","imagery,firefly,cinematic,esri_basemap,basemap,baseimagery,hybrid","This map features an alternative view of the World Imagery map designed to be used as a neutral imagery basemap, with de-saturated colors, that is useful for overlaying other brightly styled layers.  The map also includes a reference layer.","","Source: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS, USDA, USGS, AeroGRID, IGN, and the GIS User Community","This work is licensed under the Esri Master License Agreement.
