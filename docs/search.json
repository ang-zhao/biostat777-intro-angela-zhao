Open Baltimore contains the urls for JSON files containing the data we need. Neighbourhood-specific mortality data for six different age groups (Infant, 1-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65-84) were collected for between 2011 and 2018.\nWe also downloaded socioeconomic data such as Percent of Households with No Vehicle Available, Percent of Households with No Internet at Home, and Fast Food Outlet Density per 1,000 Residents.\nNext, we load the JSON files that were retrieved from the urls in Open Baltimore.\n\n\n\nAfter loading the data, we extract important features, such as mortality rate and transform the data to long format for visualization. An example of how this is done is below.\n\n\n\nAfter reading in theh JSON files and extracting our desired features, the data dictionary looks like this.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  CSA2010                        year mort_rate age_group\n  <chr>                         <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>    \n1 Allendale/Irvington/S.

    "text": "Results\nWe used a variety of plots to visualize the relationships between socioeconomic covariates and mortality rates over time and across age groups. Scatter plots and trend lines were used to show correlations, and spatial maps were generated to highlight geographical variations in mortality.\n\nMortality Over Time by Age Group\nFigure 1 visualizes mortality rates across multiple age groups (Infant, 1-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65-84) from 2011 to 2018.\nWe notice that…\n\nInfant Mortality: While lower than the older age groups, there are notable spikes in infant mortality, particularly in 2016.\nYouth (1-14 and 15-24): These groups maintain relatively low mortality rates over time.\nOlder Age Groups (45-64 and 65-84): These groups consistently exhibit higher mortality rates compared to younger groups. The mortality rate in these groups shows some fluctuations, but overall, the trend remains stable over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mortality Over Time by Age Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocioeconomic Covariates vs. Mortality Rates\nThe first panel shows the distributions of each socioeconomic covariate across Baltimore neighbourhoods.\n\nFast Food Outlet Density: The distribution is heavily skewed towards low fast food density per 1,000 residents with a few outliers.\nPercentage of Households with No Internet at Home: A notable proportion of households have no internet access, with the distribution showing multiple peaks around 15-20% and 25-35%.\nPercentage of Households with No Vehicles Availabile: A notable percentage of households lack vehicle access, with the median falling around 30% and some areas reaching over 60%.\n\nThe remaining panels illustrate the relationships between each of the socioeconomic covariates and mortality rates, stratified by age group.
